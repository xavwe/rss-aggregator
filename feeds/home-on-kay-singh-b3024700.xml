This deal &ndash; reportedly worth over $100 million &ndash; is one of the most lucrative podcast deals. The presence of this deal, let alone the magnitude, is rare for the podcast ecosystem, which is built on open principles <em>i.e. all podcasts are available everywhere</em>. Therefore, the concept of exclusivity does not exist in the vocabulary of podcast listeners nor podcast creators. For Spotify to spend a considerable sum of money on a medium that is not its core business <em>(i.e. music)</em> represents a significant shift in strategy. In this blog, I explore why Spotify is embarking on this journey, and the value Spotify can deliver in this space.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 3 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AV1 Ecosystem Update: January 2020</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-january-2020/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>January is usually a big month for tech because the Consumer Electronics Shows kicks off every year in Las Vegas.

<p>It&rsquo;s not often you see so many logos of tech giants <a href="http://aomedia.org/membership/members/">on one page backing the same technology</a>. In my experience, every enterprise has developed a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> and come up with their standards. No surprise then that there&rsquo;s an XKCD describing this phenomenon!</p>
<p><img alt="XKCD on Standards" loading="lazy" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png"></p>
<p>But when the AV1 1.0.0 spec was finalized in 2018, with the backing of so many giants, the world knew AV1 would be a serious piece of tech. With the spec finalized, the race was on to get AV1 integrated into your favorite software &amp; hardware for encoding, decoding, and viewing media. By the end of 2018, AV1 adoption was moving at a healthy pace and completed significant milestones necessary to mainstream adoption. Some of these were:</p>]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AV1 Ecosystem Update: December 2019</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/av1-ecosystem-update-december-2019/</link><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="dav1d-052-asiatic-cheetah-released">dav1d 0.5.2 &lsquo;Asiatic Cheetah&rsquo; released</h1>

It looks like we'll be waiting a lot longer for such a chip from Qualcomm. In what might come as a shock, MediaTek announced the first SOC to feature such support with their new Dimensity 1000 chip.

In addition to an OS disk, each VM also has a temporary disk that is present on the compute cluster hosting your VM.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-my-os-disk-not--devsda">Why is my OS disk not @ /dev/sda?</h2>
<p>In most cases the OS disk is <code>/dev/sda</code> but in some odd cases it is not. This is not an Azure specific issue but a default Linux behavior. The ordering in which Linux enumerates SCSI devices is nondeterministic. It scans SCSI devices in the order they appear on the PCI Bus. Therefore, whichever disk is enumerated first is <code>/dev/sda</code>.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>It&apos;s time to replace GIFs with AV1 video!</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/its-time-replace-gifs-with-av1-video/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>It is 2019 and we need to make a decision about GIFs (<a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/battle-over-gif-pronunciation-erupts/">no, not that

But before I begin
this story, I need to take you back to 2006. You see back in 2006 as a
young technologist, my choices of a web browser were limited. It was
either Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. But then one day while
browsing through PC World magazine, I discovered an alternate option –
Opera.</p>
<p>Opera had <a href="https://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/05/10-features-youll-find-only-in-opera.html">many differentiated
features</a>
such as a customizable streamlined user interface as well as being <a href="https://www.garyshood.com/browser/">more
memory efficient</a> and <a href="http://lowendmac.com/2005/whats-the-fastest-mac-browser-across-platforms/">faster than
Firefox</a>.
There were many other features that made Opera my go-to browser but the
most important for my browsing on a 256 Kbps turned out to be the
“Instant-back”. Normally, when you press the back button in a browser,
it will try to reload the page but in Opera the page loaded from cache,
so the back action was instant!</p>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 9 Mar 2019 19:03:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Microsoft Ignite 2018: VM Scale Sets + Shared Image Gallery = Infrastructure at scale - BRK3339</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/ignite2018-vm-scale-sets-shared-image-gallery-infrastructure/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>When you need to create a lot of instances from a custom VM image, VM Scale Sets and Shared Image Gallery are the services you need to use.

This VM type is meant to compete directly with AWS&rsquo; T2 instances. In the below few words (or more :smile: ) I try to explain what this means and why you should care. If you still have questions after reading, hit me up on Twitter or leave a comment below.</p>
<h1 id="so-why-do-i-need-a-burstable-size-anyway">So why do I need a burstable size anyway?</h1>
<p>If you have applications that remain idle for a long time and burst occasionally, then the B-series might be the perfect fit for you. To understand why, we first need to understand how the pricing for a VM works in the cloud. When you deploy a VM in the cloud, you&rsquo;re paying the same regardless of the % of CPU used. Therefore, anytime your VM is not using 100% CPU, you are leaving computing cycles on the table that you are paying for. Typically, users will solve this problem by deploying a VM size with smaller number of cores and lesser RAM. However, sometimes the application demands more computing power. This is a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling">vertical scalability problem</a>. As the <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/122050/what-limits-cpu-speed">physics of semiconductors</a> limits the number of cores, CPU clock speeds and RAM you can add to a single node, users have solved this problem by developing applications that can scale horizontally to more nodes.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2017 00:59:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Integrating Azure Automation Runbook Output with Logic Apps</title><link>https://singhkays.com/blog/azure-automation-runbook-output-logic-apps/</link><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
