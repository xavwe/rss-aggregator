            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I recently tried using the <a href="https://amzn.to/46Y65Wo">Minisforum DEG1 GPU Dock</a> with a Raspberry Pi 500+, using an M.2 to OCuLink adapter, and <a href="https://amzn.to/48CZlyl">this chenyang SFF-8611 Cable</a>.</p>

<p>After figuring out there's a power button on the DEG1 (which needs to be turned on), and after fiddling around with the switches on the PCB (hidden under the large metal plate on the bottom; TGX to OFF was the most important setting), I was able to get the Raspberry Pi's PCIe bus to at least tell the graphics card installed in the eGPU dock to spin up its fans and initialize.</p>

<p>But I wasn't able to get any output from the card (using <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/discussions/756">this Linux kernel patch</a>), and <code>lspci</code> did not show it. (Nor were there any logs showing errors in <code>dmesg</code>).</p></div>

<p>It's nice to have a workstation set up that you can access anywhere via Screen Sharing to check on progress, jot down a note, etc.—and not be tied to a web app or some cloud service.</p>

<p>I run a Wireguard VPN at home and at my studio, so I can remotely log into any of my infrastructure through the VPN—Macs included.</p></div>

<p>I ordered a set of 10 Compute Blades in April 2023 (two years ago), and they just arrived a few weeks ago. In that time Raspberry Pi upgraded the CM4 to a CM5, so I ordered a set of 10 16GB CM5 Lite modules for my blade cluster. That should give me 160 GB of total RAM to play with.</p>

<p>This was the biggest Pi cluster I've built, and it set me back around $3,000, shipping included:</p></div>

<p>This month-long event has kicked up some dust—enough that two British YouTubers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGTKaALdHzc">Spiffing Brit</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX1eEe8erkQ">Josh Strife Hayes</a> are having a very British argument<sup id="british"><a href="#fn:british" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> over who's right about the root cause.</p>

<p>Spiffing Brit argued it's a mix of YouTube's seasonality (it's back to school season) and channels falling off, or as TechLinked puts it, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ5pATTvc2o">git gud</a>", while Josh Strife Hayes points out the massive number of channels which identified a <em>historic</em> shift down in desktop views (compared to mobile, tablet, and TV) starting after August 10. This data was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FUJwXeuCGc">corroborated by this Moist Critical video</a> as well.</p></div>

<p>Many YouTube content creators, myself included, noticed something in early to mid-August: views were down.</p>

<p>After being on the platform since 2006 (though for me, not being a 'professional' YouTuber until about 5 years ago), I'm used to seasonal dips, adjustments after new tweaks to the algorithm or layout/design changes.</p>

<p>I bought a used 2023 Nissan Leaf in 2025, my first 'new' car in 15 years. The above photo was taken by the dealership; apparently their social media team likes to post photos of all purchasers.</p>

<p>I test drove a Tesla in 2012, and quickly realized my mistake. No gasoline-powered car (outside of supercars, maybe? Never drove one of those) could match the feel of pressing the throttle on an electric.</p>

<p>I started out with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.</p></div>
