<p>Today Raspberry Pi launched their new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-hat-plus-2/">$130 AI HAT+ 2</a> which includes a Hailo 10H and 8 GB of <a href="https://www.micron.com/products/memory/dram-components/lpddr4/part-catalog/part-detail/mt53e2g32d4de-046-wt-c">LPDDR4X RAM</a>.</p>
<p>With that, the Hailo 10H is capable of running LLMs entirely standalone, freeing the Pi's CPU and system RAM for other tasks. The chip runs at a maximum of 3W, with 40 TOPS of INT8 NPU inference performance in addition to the equivalent 26 TOPS INT4 machine vision performance on the earlier AI HAT with Hailo 8.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Pico Mini Rack GPS Clock</title><link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/pico-gps-clock-mini-rack/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to have the most accurate timepiece possible mounted in my mini rack.

<p>This is a GPS-based clock running on a Raspberry Pi Pico in a custom 1U 10&quot; rack faceplate. The clock displays time based on a GPS input, and will not display time until a GPS timing lock has been acquired.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you turn on the Pico, the display reads <code>----</code></li>
<li>Upon 3D fix, you get a time on the clock, and the colon starts blinking</li>
<li>If the 3D fix is lost, the colon goes solid</li>
<li>When the 3D fix is regained, the colon starts blinking again</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What's the point?</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi only has 1 lane of PCIe Gen 3 bandwidth available for a connection to an eGPU. That's not much. Especially considering a modern desktop has at least one slot with 16 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 bandwidth. That's 8 GT/s versus 512 GT/s.

<p>The stack of Macs I tested, with 1.5 TB of unified memory, costs just shy of $40,000, and if you're wondering, no I cannot justify spending that much money for this.
