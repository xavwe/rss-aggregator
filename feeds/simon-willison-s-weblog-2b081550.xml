<h4 id="agents-rule-of-two-a-practical-approach-to-ai-agent-security">Agents Rule of Two: A Practical Approach to AI Agent Security</h4>
<p>The first is <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/practical-ai-agent-security/">Agents Rule of Two: A Practical Approach to AI Agent Security</a>, published on October 31st on the Meta AI blog. It doesn't list authors but it was <a href="https://x.com/MickAyzenberg/status/1984355145917088235">shared on Twitter</a> by Meta AI security researcher Mick Ayzenberg.</p>
<p>It proposes a "Rule of Two" that's inspired by both my own <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">lethal trifecta</a> concept and the Google Chrome team's <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md">Rule Of 2</a> for writing code that works with untrustworthy inputs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a high level, the Agents Rule of Two states that until robustness research allows us to reliably detect and refuse prompt injection, agents <strong>must satisfy no more than two</strong> of the following three properties within a session to avoid the highest impact consequences of prompt injection.</p>
<p><strong>[A]</strong> An agent can process untrustworthy inputs</p>
<p><strong>[B]</strong> An agent can have access to sensitive systems or private data</p>
<p><strong>[C]</strong> An agent can change state or communicate externally</p>
<p>It's still possible that all three properties are necessary to carry out a request. If an agent requires all three without starting a new session (i.e., with a fresh context window), then the agent should not be permitted to operate autonomously and at a minimum requires supervision --- via human-in-the-loop approval or another reliable means of validation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's accompanied by this handy diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/agents-rule-of-two-updated.jpg" alt="Venn diagram titled &quot;Choose Two&quot; showing three overlapping circles labeled A, B, and C. Circle A (top): &quot;Process untrustworthy inputs&quot; with description &quot;Externally authored data may contain prompt injection attacks that turn an agent malicious.&quot; Circle B (bottom left): &quot;Access to sensitive systems or private data&quot; with description &quot;This includes private user data, company secrets, production settings and configs, source code, and other sensitive data.&quot; Circle C (bottom right): &quot;Change state or communicate externally&quot; with description &quot;Overwrite or change state through write actions, or transmitting data to a threat actor through web requests or tool calls.&quot; The two-way overlaps between circles are labeled &quot;Lower risk&quot; while the center where all three circles overlap is labeled &quot;Danger&quot;." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I like this <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<p>I've spent several years now trying to find clear ways to explain the risks of prompt injection attacks to developers who are building on top of LLMs. It's frustratingly difficult.</p>
<p>I've had the most success with the lethal trifecta, which boils one particular class of prompt injection attack down to a simple-enough model: if your system has access to private data, exposure to untrusted content and a way to communicate externally then it's vulnerable to private data being stolen.</p>
<p>The one problem with the lethal trifecta is that it only covers the risk of data exfiltration: there are plenty of other, even nastier risks that arise from prompt injection attacks against LLM-powered agents with access to tools which the lethal trifecta doesn't cover.</p>
<p>The Agents Rule of Two neatly solves this, through the addition of "changing state" as a property to consider. This brings other forms of tool usage into the picture: anything that can change state triggered by untrustworthy inputs is something to be very cautious about.</p>
<p>It's also refreshing to see another major research lab concluding that prompt injection remains an unsolved problem, and attempts to block or filter them have not proven reliable enough to depend on. The current solution is to design systems with this in mind, and the Rule of Two is a solid way to think about that.</p>
<p id="exception"><strong>Update</strong>: On thinking about this further there's one aspect of the Rule of Two model that doesn't work for me: the Venn diagram above marks the combination of untrustworthy inputs and the ability to change state as "safe", but that's not right. Even without access to private systems or sensitive data that pairing can still produce harmful results. Unfortunately adding an exception for that pair undermines the simplicity of the "Rule of Two" framing!</p>
<p id="update-2"><strong>Update 2</strong>: Mick Ayzenberg responded to this note in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45794245#45802448">a comment on Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the feedback! One small bit of clarification, the framework would describe access to any sensitive system as part of the [B] circle, not only private systems or private data.</p>
<p>The intention is that an agent that has removed [B] can write state and communicate freely, but not with any systems that matter (wrt critical security outcomes for its user). An example of an agent in this state would be one that can take actions in a tight sandbox or is isolated from production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Meta team also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45794245#45802046">updated their post</a> to replace "safe" with "lower risk" as the label on the intersections between the different circles. I've updated my screenshots of their diagrams in this post, <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/agents-rule-of-two.jpg">here's the original</a> for comparison.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the second paper...</p>
<h4 id="the-attacker-moves-second-stronger-adaptive-attacks-bypass-defenses-against-llm-jailbreaks-and-prompt-injections">The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against LLM Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections</h4>
<p>This paper is dated 10th October 2025 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09023">on Arxiv</a> and comes from a heavy-hitting team of 14 authors - Milad Nasr, Nicholas Carlini, Chawin Sitawarin, Sander V. Schulhoff, Jamie Hayes, Michael Ilie, Juliette Pluto, Shuang Song, Harsh Chaudhari, Ilia Shumailov, Abhradeep Thakurta, Kai Yuanqing Xiao, Andreas Terzis, Florian Tramèr - including representatives from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.</p>
<p>The paper looks at 12 published defenses against prompt injection and jailbreaking and subjects them to a range of "adaptive attacks" - attacks that are allowed to expend considerable effort iterating multiple times to try and find a way through.</p>
<p>The defenses did not fare well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By systematically tuning and scaling general optimization techniques—gradient descent, reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration—we bypass 12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally reported near-zero attack success rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably the "Human red-teaming setting" scored 100%, defeating all defenses. That red-team consisted of 500 participants in an online competition they ran with a $20,000 prize fund.</p>
<p>The key point of the paper is that static example attacks - single string prompts designed to bypass systems - are an almost useless way to evaluate these defenses. Adaptive attacks are far more powerful, as shown by this chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/attack-success-rate.jpg" alt="Bar chart showing Attack Success Rate (%) for various security systems across four categories: Prompting, Training, Filtering Model, and Secret Knowledge. The chart compares three attack types shown in the legend: Static / weak attack (green hatched bars), Automated attack (ours) (orange bars), and Human red-teaming (ours) (purple dotted bars). Systems and their success rates are: Spotlighting (28% static, 99% automated), Prompt Sandwich (21% static, 95% automated), RPO (0% static, 99% automated), Circuit Breaker (8% static, 100% automated), StruQ (62% static, 100% automated), SeqAlign (5% static, 96% automated), ProtectAI (15% static, 90% automated), PromptGuard (26% static, 94% automated), PIGuard (0% static, 71% automated), Model Armor (0% static, 90% automated), Data Sentinel (0% static, 80% automated), MELON (0% static, 89% automated), and Human red-teaming setting (0% static, 100% human red-teaming)." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>The three automated adaptive attack techniques used by the paper are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Gradient-based methods</strong> - these were the least effective, using the technique described in the legendary <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043">Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models</a> paper <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/27/universal-and-transferable-attacks-on-aligned-language-models/">from 2023</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reinforcement learning methods</strong> - particularly effective against black-box models: "we allowed the attacker model to interact directly with the defended system and observe its outputs", using 32 sessions of 5 rounds each.</li>
<li>
<strong>Search-based methods</strong> - generate candidates with an LLM, then evaluate and further modify them using LLM-as-judge and other classifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper concludes somewhat optimistically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] Adaptive evaluations are therefore more challenging to perform,
making it all the more important that they are performed. We again urge defense authors to release simple, easy-to-prompt defenses that are amenable to human analysis. [...] Finally, we hope that our analysis here will increase the standard for defense evaluations, and in so doing, increase the likelihood that reliable jailbreak and prompt injection defenses will be developed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given how totally the defenses were defeated, I do not share their optimism that reliable defenses will be developed any time soon.</p>
<p>As a review of how far we still have to go this paper packs a powerful punch. I think it makes a strong case for Meta's Agents Rule of Two as the best practical advice for building secure LLM-powered agent systems today in the absence of prompt injection defenses we can rely on.</p>

Useful, detailed guide from Shrivu Shankar, a Claude Code power user. Lots of tips for both individual Claude Code usage and configuring it for larger team projects.</p>
<p>I appreciated Shrivu's take on MCP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "Scripting" model (now formalized by Skills) is better, but it needs a secure way to access the environment. This to me is the new, more focused role for MCP.</p>
<p>Instead of a bloated API, an MCP should be a simple, secure gateway that provides a few powerful, high-level tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>download_raw_data(filters...)</code></li>
<li><code>take_sensitive_gated_action(args...)</code></li>
<li><code>execute_code_in_environment_with_state(code...)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In this model, MCP's job isn't to abstract reality for the agent; its job is to manage the auth, networking, and security boundaries and then get out of the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes a lot of sense to me. Most of my MCP usage with coding agents like Claude Code has been replaced by custom shell scripts for it to execute, but there's still a useful role for MCP in helping the agent access secure resources in a controlled way.

Go cryptography author Filippo Valsorda reports on some very positive results applying Claude Code to the challenge of implementing novel cryptography algorithms. After Claude was able to resolve a "fairly complex low-level bug" in fresh code he tried it against two other examples and got positive results both time.</p>
<p>Filippo isn't directly using Claude's solutions to the bugs, but is finding it useful for tracking down the cause and saving him a solid amount of debugging work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three out of three one-shot debugging hits with no help is <em>extremely impressive</em>. Importantly, there is no need to trust the LLM or review its output when its job is just saving me an hour or two by telling me where the bug is, for me to reason about it and fix it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using coding agents in this way may represent a useful entrypoint for LLM-skeptics who wouldn't <em>dream</em> of letting an autocomplete-machine writing code on their behalf.

I don't usually cover startup acquisitions here, but this one feels relevant to several of my interests.</p>
<p>Marimo (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/marimo/">previously</a>) provide an open source (Apache 2 licensed) notebook tool for Python, with first-class support for an additional WebAssembly build plus an optional hosted service. It's effectively a reimagining of Jupyter notebooks as a reactive system, where cells automatically update based on changes to other cells - similar to how <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> JavaScript notebooks work.</p>
<p>The first public Marimo release was in January 2024 and the tool has "been in development since 2022" (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44304607#44330375">source</a>).</p>
<p>CoreWeave are a <em>big</em> player in the AI data center space. They started out as an Ethereum mining company in 2017, then pivoted to cloud computing infrastructure for AI companies after the 2018 cryptocurrency crash. They IPOd in March 2025 and today they operate more than 30 data centers worldwide and have announced a number of eye-wateringly sized deals with companies such as Cohere and OpenAI. I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreWeave">their Wikipedia page</a> very helpful.</p>
<p>They've also been on an acquisition spree this year, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weights &amp; Biases <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/blog/coreweave-completes-acquisition-of-weights-biases">in March 2025</a> (deal closed in May), the AI training observability platform.</li>
<li>OpenPipe <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/news/coreweave-to-acquire-openpipe-leader-in-reinforcement-learning">in September 2025</a> - a reinforcement learning platform, authors of the <a href="https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART">Agent Reinforcement Trainer</a> Apache 2 licensed open source RL framework.</li>
<li>Monolith AI <a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-to-Acquire-Monolith-Expanding-AI-Cloud-Platform-into-Industrial-Innovation/default.aspx">in October 2025</a>, a UK-based AI model SaaS platform focused on AI for engineering and industrial manufacturing.</li>
<li>And now Marimo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marimo's own announcement emphasizes continued investment in that tool:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marimo is joining CoreWeave. We’re continuing to build the open-source marimo notebook, while also leveling up molab with serious compute. Our long-term mission remains the same: to build the world’s best open-source programming environment for working with data.</p>
<p>marimo is, and always will be, free, open-source, and permissively licensed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give CoreWeave's buying spree only really started this year it's impossible to say how well these acquisitions are likely to play out - they haven't yet established a track record.

Here's the second fast coding model released by a coding agent IDE in the same day - the first was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/29/cursor-composer/">Composer-1 by Cursor</a>. This time it's Windsurf releasing SWE-1.5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we’re releasing SWE-1.5, the latest in our family of models optimized for software engineering. It is a frontier-size model with hundreds of billions of parameters that achieves near-SOTA coding performance. It also sets a new standard for speed: we partnered with Cerebras to serve it at up to 950 tok/s – 6x faster than Haiku 4.5 and 13x faster than Sonnet 4.5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Composer-1 it's only available via their editor, no separate API yet. Also like Composer-1 they don't appear willing to share details of the "leading open-source base model" they based their new model on.</p>
<p>I asked it to generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle and got this:</p>
<p><img alt="Bicycle has a red upside down Y shaped frame, pelican is a bit dumpy, it does at least have a long sharp beak." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/swe-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>This one felt <em>really fast</em>. Partnering with Cerebras for inference is a very smart move.</p>
<p>They share a lot of details about their training process in the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SWE-1.5 is trained on our state-of-the-art cluster of thousands of GB200 NVL72 chips. We believe SWE-1.5 may be the first public production model trained on the new GB200 generation. [...]</p>
<p>Our RL rollouts require high-fidelity environments with code execution and even web browsing. To achieve this, we leveraged our VM hypervisor <code>otterlink</code> that  allows us to scale <strong>Devin</strong> to tens of thousands of concurrent machines (learn more about <a href="https://cognition.ai/blog/blockdiff#why-incremental-vm-snapshots">blockdiff</a>). This enabled us to smoothly support very high concurrency and ensure the training environment is aligned with our Devin production environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's <em>another</em> similarity to Cursor's Composer-1! Cursor talked about how they ran "hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud" in <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/composer">their description of their RL training</a> as well.</p>
<p>This is a notable trend: if you want to build a really great agentic coding tool there's clearly a lot to be said for using reinforcement learning to fine-tune a model against your own custom set of tools using large numbers of sandboxed simulated coding environments as part of that process.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://x.com/zai_org/status/1984076614951420273">I think it's built on GLM</a>.

MiniMax M2 was released on Monday 27th October by MiniMax, a Chinese AI lab founded in December 2021.</p>
<p>It's a very promising model. Their self-reported benchmark scores show it as comparable to Claude Sonnet 4, and Artificial Analysis <a href="https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1982714153375854998">are ranking it</a> as the best currently available open weight model according to their intelligence score:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MiniMax’s M2 achieves a new all-time-high Intelligence Index score for an open weights model and offers impressive efficiency with only 10B active parameters (200B total). [...]</p>
<p>The model’s strengths include tool use and instruction following (as shown by Tau2 Bench and IFBench). As such, while M2 likely excels at agentic use cases it may underperform other open weights leaders such as DeepSeek V3.2 and Qwen3 235B at some generalist tasks. This is in line with a number of recent open weights model releases from Chinese AI labs which focus on agentic capabilities, likely pointing to a heavy post-training emphasis on RL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The size is particularly significant: the model weights are 230GB <a href="https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2">on Hugging Face</a>, significantly smaller than other high performing open weight models. That's small enough to run on a 256GB Mac Studio, and the MLX community <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/MiniMax-M2-8bit">have that working already</a>.</p>
<p>MiniMax offer their own API, and recommend using their Anthropic-compatible endpoint and the official Anthropic SDKs to access it. MiniMax Head of Engineering Skyler Miao
 <a href="https://x.com/SkylerMiao7/status/1982989507252367687">provided some background on that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>M2 is a agentic thinking model, it do interleaved thinking like sonnet 4.5, which means every response will contain its thought content.
Its very important for M2 to keep the chain of thought. So we must make sure the history thought passed back to the model.
Anthropic API support it for sure, as sonnet needs it as well. OpenAI only support it in their new Response API, no support for in ChatCompletion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MiniMax are offering the new model via their API for free until November 7th, after which the cost will be $0.30/million input tokens and $1.20/million output tokens - similar in price to Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-5 Mini, see <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=51&amp;ot=4017&amp;sel=minimax-m2%2Cgpt-5-mini%2Cclaude-3-haiku%2Cgemini-2.5-flash-lite%2Cgemini-2.5-flash">price comparison here</a> on my <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> site.</p>
<p>I released a new plugin for <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-minimax">llm-minimax</a> providing support for M2 via the MiniMax API:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-minimax
llm keys set minimax
# Paste key here
llm -m m2 -o max_tokens 10000 "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/da79447830dc431c067a93648b338be6">the result</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Biycle is good though obscured by the pelican. Pelican has an impressive triple beak and is stretched along the bicycle frame. Not clear if it can pedal or what it is sitting on." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/m2-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>51 input, 4,017 output. At $0.30/m input and $1.20/m output that pelican would cost 0.4836 cents - less than half a cent.</p>
<p>This is the first plugin I've written for an Anthropic-API-compatible model. I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.21">llm-anthropic 0.21</a> first adding the ability to customize the <code>base_url</code> parameter when using that model class. This meant the new plugin was less than <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-minimax/blob/0.1/llm_minimax.py">30 lines of Python</a>.

Cursor released <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/2-0">Cursor 2.0 today</a>, with a refreshed UI focused on agentic coding (and running agents in parallel) and a new model that's unique to Cursor called <strong>Composer&nbsp;1</strong>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell there's no way to call the model directly via an API, so I fired up "Ask" mode in Cursor's chat side panel and asked it to "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle":</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Cursor 2 - In the chat panel I have asked the question and it spat out a bunch of SVG." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cursor-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/e5c9176f153ca718370055ecd256fe70">the result</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="The bicycle is levitating against a blue sky. The pelican looks a little bit more like a baby chicken but does at least have a long beak." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cursor-1-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>The notable thing about Composer-1 is that it is designed to be <em>fast</em>. The pelican certainly came back quickly, and in their announcement they describe it as being "4x faster than similarly intelligent models".</p>
<p>It's interesting to see Cursor investing resources in training their own code-specific model - similar to <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/">GPT-5-Codex</a> or <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder">Qwen3-Coder</a>. From their post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Composer is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model supporting long-context generation and understanding. It is specialized for software engineering through reinforcement learning (RL) in a diverse range of development environments. [...]</p>
<p>Efficient training of large MoE models requires significant investment into building infrastructure and systems research. We built custom training infrastructure leveraging PyTorch and Ray to power asynchronous reinforcement learning at scale. We natively train our models at low precision by combining our <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/kernels">MXFP8 MoE kernels</a> with expert parallelism and hybrid sharded data parallelism, allowing us to scale training to thousands of NVIDIA GPUs with minimal communication cost. [...]</p>
<p>During RL, we want our model to be able to call any tool in the Cursor Agent harness. These tools allow editing code, using semantic search, grepping strings, and running terminal commands. At our scale, teaching the model to effectively call these tools requires running hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One detail that's notably absent from their description: did they train the model from scratch, or did they start with an existing open-weights model such as something from Qwen or GLM?</p>
<p>Cursor researcher Sasha Rush has been answering questions <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45748725">on Hacker News</a>, but has so far been evasive in answering questions about the base model. When directly asked "is Composer a fine tune of an existing open source base model?" they replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our primary focus is on RL post-training. We think that is the best way to get the model to be a strong interactive agent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sasha <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45748725#45750784">did confirm</a> that rumors of an earlier Cursor preview model, Cheetah, being based on a model by xAI's Grok were "Straight up untrue."

Yesterday I picked up my conference badge... which incorporates a <s>full Raspberry Pi</s> Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller with a battery, color screen, WiFi and bluetooth.</p>
<p>GitHub Universe has a tradition of hackable conference badges - the badge last year had an eInk display. This year's is a huge upgrade though - a color screen and WiFI connection makes this thing a genuinely useful little computer!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gitub-universe-badge.jpg" alt="Photo of the badge - it has a color screen with six app icons" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>The only thing it's missing is a keyboard - the device instead provides five buttons total - Up, Down, A, B, C. It might be possible to get a bluetooth keyboard to work though I'll believe that when I see it - there's not a lot of space on this device for a keyboard driver.</p>
<p>Everything is written using MicroPython, and the device is designed to be hackable: connect it to a laptop with a USB-C cable and you can start modifying the code directly on the device.</p>
<h4 id="getting-setup-with-the-badge">Getting setup with the badge</h4>
<p>Out of the box the badge will play an opening animation (implemented as a sequence of PNG image frames) and then show a home screen with six app icons.</p>
<p>The default apps are mostly neat Octocat-themed demos: a flappy-bird clone, a tamagotchi-style pet, a drawing app that works like an etch-a-sketch, an IR scavenger hunt for the conference venue itself (this thing has an IR sensor too!), and a gallery app showing some images.</p>
<p>The sixth app is a badge app. This will show your GitHub profile image and some basic stats, but will only work if you dig out a USB-C cable and make some edits to the files on the badge directly.</p>
<p>I did this on a Mac. I plugged a USB-C cable into the badge which caused MacOS to treat it as an attached drive volume. In that drive are several files including <code>secrets.py</code>. Open that up, confirm the WiFi details are correct and add your GitHub username. The file should look like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-c1">WIFI_SSID</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"..."</span>
<span class="pl-c1">WIFI_PASSWORD</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"..."</span>
<span class="pl-c1">GITHUB_USERNAME</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"simonw"</span></pre>
<p>The badge comes with the SSID and password for the GitHub Universe WiFi network pre-populated.</p>
<p>That's it! Unmount the disk, hit the reboot button on the back of the badge and when it comes back up again the badge app should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-profile.jpg" alt="Badge shows my GitHub avatar, plus 10,947 followers, 4,083 contribs, 893 repos" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<h4 id="building-your-own-apps">Building your own apps</h4>
<p>Here's <a href="https://badger.github.io/">the official documentation</a> for building software for the badge.</p>
<p>When I got mine yesterday the official repo had not yet been updated, so I had to figure this out myself.</p>
<p>I copied all of the code across to my laptop, added it to a Git repo and then fired up Claude Code and told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Investigate this code and add a detailed README</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/15773c7a53275e7836216c3aa9a8a781c06f7859/README.md">the result</a>, which was really useful for getting a start on understanding how it all worked.</p>
<p>Each of the six default apps lives in a <code>apps/</code> folder, for example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/sketch">apps/sketch/</a> for the sketching app.</p>
<p>There's also a menu app which powers the home screen. That lives in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/tree/main/apps/menu">apps/menu/</a>. You can edit code in here to add new apps that you create to that screen.</p>
<p>I told Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a new app to it available from the menu which shows network status and other useful debug info about the machine it is running on</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a bit of a long-shot, but it totally worked!</p>
<p>The first version had an error:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-error.jpg" alt="A stacktrace! file badgeware.py line 510 has a list index out of range error." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I OCRd that photo (with the Apple Photos app) and pasted the message into Claude Code and it fixed the problem.</p>
<p>This almost worked... but the addition of a seventh icon to the 2x3 grid meant that you could select the icon but it didn't scroll into view. I had Claude <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/commit/2a60f75db101dc1dc7568ff466ad5c97dc86b336">fix that for me too</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the code for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/github-universe-2025-badge/blob/main/apps/debug/__init__.py">apps/debug/__init__.py</a>, and <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?276d3e0c6566ddbc93adc7020ef6b439">the full Claude Code transcript</a> created using my terminal-to-HTML app <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">described here</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the four screens of the debug app:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-debug-network.jpg" alt="Network info, showing WiFi network details and IP address" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

<h4 id="an-icon-editor">An icon editor</h4>
<p>The icons used on the app are 24x24 pixels. I decided it would be neat to have a web app that helps build those icons, including the ability to start by creating an icon from an emoji.</p>
<p>I bulit this one <a href="https://claude.ai/share/ca05bd58-859e-4ceb-b5c7-7428b348df3c">using Claude Artifacts</a>. Here's the result, now available at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor">tools.simonwillison.net/icon-editor</a>:</p>

<h4 id="and-a-repl">And a REPL</h4>
<p>I noticed that last year's badge configuration app (which I can't find in <a href="https://github.com/badger/badger.github.io/">github.com/badger/badger.github.io</a> any more, I think they reset the history on that repo?) worked by talking to MicroPython over the Web Serial API from Chrome. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/2004-badger.github.io/blob/e3501d631a987bfbc12d93c9e35bf2c64e55d052/public/script.js#L305-L394">my archived copy of that code</a>.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be useful to have a REPL in a web UI that you could use to interact with the badge directly over USB?</p>
<p>I pointed Claude Code at a copy of that repo and told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Based on this build a new HTML with inline JavaScript page that uses WebUSB to simply test that the connection to the badge works and then list files on that device using the same mechanism</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took a bit of poking (here's <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?13d93a9e3b0ce1c921cd20303f2f1d84">the transcript</a>) but the result is now live at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl">tools.simonwillison.net/badge-repl</a>. It only works in Chrome - you'll need to plug the badge in with a USB-C cable and then click "Connect to Badge".</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/badge-repl.jpg" alt="Badge Interactive REPL. Note: This tool requires the Web Serial API (Chrome/Edge on desktop).

<h4 id="get-hacking">Get hacking</h4>
<p>If you're a GitHub Universe attendee I hope this is useful. The official <a href="https://badger.github.io/">badger.github.io</a> site has plenty more details to help you get started.</p>
<p>There isn't yet a way to get hold of this hardware outside of GitHub Universe - I know they had some supply chain challenges just getting enough badges for the conference attendees!</p>
<p>It's a very neat device, built for GitHub by <a href="https://www.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni</a> in Sheffield, UK. A version of this should become generally available in the future under the name "Pimoroni Tufty 2350".</p>

<h4 id="iphone-only">Update: Setup with iPhone only</h4>

<p>If you don't have a laptop with you it's still possible to start hacking on the device using just a USB-C cable.</p>

The Python Software Foundation was recently "recommended for funding" (NSF terminology) for a $1.5m grant from the US government National Science Foundation to help improve the security of the Python software ecosystem, after an grant application process lead by Seth Larson and Loren Crary.</p>
<p>The PSF's annual budget is less than $6m so this is a meaningful amount of money for the organization!</p>
<p>We were forced to withdraw our application and turn down the funding, thanks to new language that was added to the agreement requiring us to affirm that we "do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws."</p>
<p>Our legal advisors confirmed that this would not just apply to security work covered by the grant - this would apply to all of the PSF's activities.</p>
<p>This was not an option for us. Here's the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/">mission</a> of the PSF:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we accepted and spent the money despite this term, there was a very real risk that the money could be clawed back later. That represents an existential risk for the foundation since we would have already spent the money!</p>
<p>I was one of the board members who voted to reject this funding - a unanimous but tough decision. I’m proud to serve on a board that can make difficult decisions like this.</p>
<p>If you'd like to sponsor the PSF you can find out more <a href="https://www.python.org/sponsors/application/">on our site</a>. I'd love to see a few more of the large AI labs show up <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/">on our top-tier visionary sponsors list</a>.

Useful collection of examples by Shaun Pedicini who tested Seedream 4, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen-Image-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext [dev], FLUX.1 Kontext [max], OmniGen2, and OpenAI gpt-image-1 across 12 image editing prompts.</p>
<p>The tasks are very neatly selected, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Remove all the brown pieces of candy from the glass bowl</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Qwen-Image-Edit (a model that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/19/qwen-image-edit/">can be self-hosted</a>) was the only one to successfully manage that!</p>
<p>This kind of collection is really useful for building up an intuition as to how well image editing models work, and which ones are worth trying for which categories of task.</p>
<p>Shaun has <a href="https://genai-showdown.specr.net/">a similar page for text-to-image models</a> which are not fed an initial image to modify, with further challenging prompts like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Two Prussian soldiers wearing spiked pith helmets are facing each other and playing a game of ring toss by attempting to toss metal rings over the spike on the other soldier's helmet.</code></p>

Katie Notopoulos turned on the Sora 2 option where anyone can make a video featuring her cameo, and then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found a stranger had made a video where I appeared pregnant. A quick look at the user's profile, and I saw that this person's entire Sora profile was made up of this genre — video after video of women with big, pregnant bellies. I recognized immediately what this was: fetish content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feels like an intractable problem to me: given the enormous array of fetishes it's hard to imagine a classifier that could protect people from having their likeness used in this way.</p>
<p>Best to be aware of this risk before turning on any settings that allow strangers to reuse your image... and that's only an option for tools that implement a robust opt-in mechanism like Sora does.

Here's my reply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good automated tests which the coding agent can run. I love pytest for this - one of my projects has 1500 tests and Claude Code is really good at selectively executing just tests relevant to the change it is making, and then running the whole suite at the end.</li>
<li>Give them the ability to interactively test the code they are writing too. Notes on how to start a development server (for web projects) are useful, then you can have them use Playwright or curl to try things out.</li>
<li>I'm having great results from maintaining a GitHub issues collection for projects and pasting URLs to issues directly into Claude Code.</li>
<li>I actually don't think documentation is too important: LLMs can read the code a lot faster than you to figure out how to use it. I have comprehensive documentation across all of my projects but I don't think it's that helpful for the coding agents, though they are good at helping me spot if it needs updating.</li>
<li>Linters, type checkers, auto-formatters - give coding agents helpful tools to run and they'll use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part anything that makes a codebase easier for humans to maintain turns out to help agents as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thought of another one: detailed error messages! If a manual or automated test fails the more information you can return back to the model the better, and stuffing extra data in the error message or assertion is a very inexpensive way to do that.</p>

New model interpretability research from Anthropic, this time focused on SVG and ASCII art generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that the same feature that activates over the eyes in an ASCII face also activates for eyes across diverse text-based modalities, including SVG code and prose in various languages. This is not limited to eyes – we found a number of cross-modal features that recognize specific concepts: from small components like mouths and ears within ASCII or SVG faces, to full visual depictions like dogs and cats. [...]</p>
<p>These features depend on the surrounding context within the visual depiction. For instance, an SVG circle element activates “eye” features only when positioned within a larger structure that activates “face” features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And really, I can't <em>not</em> link to this one given the bonus they tagged on at the end!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a bonus, we also inspected features for an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle">first popularized</a><a href="https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle"> by Simon Willison</a> as a way to test a model's artistic capabilities. We find features representing concepts including "bike", "wheels", "feet", "tail", "eyes", and "mouth" activating over the corresponding parts of the SVG code.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram showing a pelican riding a bicycle illustration alongside its SVG source code. The left side displays two versions: a completed color illustration at top with a white pelican with yellow beak on a red bicycle with blue wheels (labeled &quot;Bike&quot; and &quot;Wheels&quot;), and a line drawing sketch below with labels &quot;Fur/Wool&quot;, &quot;Eyes&quot;, &quot;Mouth&quot;, &quot;Tail&quot;, and &quot;Bird&quot;. The right side shows the corresponding SVG XML code with viewBox, rect, ellipse, circle, and path elements defining the illustration's geometry and styling." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/anthropic-pelican-bicycle.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that they can identify model features associated with visual concepts in SVG images, can they us those for steering?</p>
<p>It turns out they can! Starting with a smiley SVG (provided as XML with no indication as to what it was drawing) and then applying a negative score to the "smile" feature produced a frown instead, and worked against ASCII art as well.</p>
<p>They could also boost features like unicorn, cat, owl, or lion and get new SVG smileys clearly attempting to depict those creatures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Diagram showing a yellow smiley face in the center with bidirectional arrows connecting to six different circular faces arranged around it, with text above asking &quot;What can this face be steered into?&quot; The surrounding faces are labeled clockwise from top left: &quot;Unicorn&quot; (pink circle with yellow triangle horn and diamond earrings), &quot;Cat&quot; (gray circle with triangular ears and small nose), &quot;Wrinkles&quot; (beige circle with eyelashes and wrinkle lines), &quot;Owl&quot; (brown circle with large round eyes and small beak), &quot;Lion&quot; (orange circle with yellow inner face), and &quot;Eye&quot; (white circle with large black pupil and highlight" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/anthropic-faces.jpg" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd love to see how this behaves if you jack up the feature for the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/24/golden-gate-claude/">Golden Gate Bridge</a>.

Something I'm enjoying about Claude Code is that any time you ask it questions about <em>itself</em> it runs tool calls like these:</p>
<p><img alt="I'll check the Claude Code documentation about bash hooks to see if there's something about the   configuration that might explain why it didn't trigger. Fetch(https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude_code_docs_map.md)   ⎿  Received 25.9KB (200 OK) Fetch(https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide.md)   ⎿  Received 9.4KB (200 OK) Fetch(https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks)   ⎿  Received 2.2MB (200 OK) Ah, I see the issue! The bashHook in your settings.json is checking the $PROMPT variable, but   according to the documentation, bash hooks should:    1. Use PreToolUse hooks (not a simple bash script)   2. Parse JSON input from stdin   3. Access the command via tool_input.command in the JSON " src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-self-documentation.jpg" /></p>
<p>In this case I'd asked it about its "hooks" feature.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude_code_docs_map.md">claude_code_docs_map.md</a> file is a neat Markdown index of all of their other documentation - the same pattern advocated by <a href="https://llmstxt.org/">llms.txt</a>. Claude Code can then fetch further documentation to help it answer your question.</p>
<p>I intercepted the current Claude Code system prompt <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/2/claude-trace/">using this trick</a> and sure enough it included a note about this URL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>When the user directly asks about Claude Code (eg. "can Claude Code do...", "does Claude Code have..."), or asks in second person (eg. "are you able...", "can you do..."), or asks how to use a specific Claude Code feature (eg. implement a hook, or write a slash command), use the WebFetch tool to gather information to answer the question from Claude Code docs. The list of available docs is available at https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude_code_docs_map.md.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish other LLM products - including both ChatGPT and Claude.ai themselves - would implement a similar pattern. It's infuriating how bad LLM tools are at answering questions about themselves, though unsurprising given that their model's training data pre-dates the latest version of those tools.

<p>It turns out there are a LOT of secondary tasks which AI agents are now good enough to help out with. Some things I'm finding useful to hand off these days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before attempting a big task, write a guide to relevant areas of the codebase</li>
<li>Spike out an attempt at a big change. Often I won't use the result but I'll review it as a sketch of where to go</li>
<li>Fix typescript errors or bugs which have a clear specification</li>
<li>Write documentation about what I'm building</li>

<p>I often find it useful to run these secondary tasks async in the background -- while I'm eating lunch, or even literally overnight!</p>

<p>The problem I wanted to solve involves sharing my Claude Code CLI sessions - and the more general problem of sharing interesting things that happen in my terminal.</p>
<p>A while back I discovered (using my vibe-coded <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/clipboard-viewer">clipboard inspector</a>) that copying and pasting from the macOS terminal populates a rich text clipboard format which preserves the colors and general formatting of the terminal output.</p>
<p>The problem is that format looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>{\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf2859
\cocoatextscaling0\cocoaplatform0{\fonttbl\f0\fnil\fcharset0 Monaco;}
{\colortbl;\red255\green255\blue255;\red242\green242\blue242;\red0\green0\blue0;\red204\green98\blue70;
\red0\green0\blue0;\red97\green97\blue97;\red102\green102\blue102;\red255\
</code></pre>
<p>This struck me as the kind of thing an LLM might be able to write code to parse, so I had <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/680801ad-0804-8006-83fc-c2b209841a9c">ChatGPT take a crack at it</a> and then later <a href="https://claude.ai/share/5c12dd0e-713d-4f32-a6c1-d05dee353e4d">rewrote it from scratch with Claude Sonnet 4.5</a>. The result was <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">this rtf-to-html tool</a> which lets you paste in rich formatted text and gives you reasonably solid HTML that you can share elsewhere.</p>
<p>To share that HTML I've started habitually pasting it into a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a> and then taking advantage of <code>gitpreview.github.io</code>, a neat little unofficial tool that accepts <code>?GIST_ID</code> and displays the gist content as a standalone HTML page... which means you can link to rendered HTML that's stored in a gist.</p>
<p>So my process was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy terminal output</li>
<li>Paste into <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">rtf-to-html</a>
</li>
<li>Copy resulting HTML</li>
<li>Paste that int a new GitHub Gist</li>
<li>Grab that Gist's ID</li>
<li>Share the link to <code>gitpreview.github.io?GIST_ID</code>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Not too much hassle, but frustratingly manual if you're doing it several times a day.</p>
<h4 id="the-desired-solution">The desired solution</h4>
<p>Ideally I want a tool where I can do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy terminal output</li>
<li>Paste into a new tool</li>
<li>Click a button and get a <code>gistpreview</code> link to share</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to get Claude Code for web to build the entire thing.</p>
<h4 id="the-prompt">The prompt</h4>
<p>Here's the full prompt I used on <a href="https://claude.ai/code">claude.ai/code</a>, pointed at my <code>simonw/tools</code> repo, to build the tool:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build a new tool called terminal-to-html which lets the user copy RTF directly from their terminal and paste it into a paste area, it then produces the HTML version of that in a textarea with a copy button, below is a button that says "Save this to a Gist", and below that is a full preview. It will be very similar to the existing rtf-to-html.html tool but it doesn't show the raw RTF and it has that Save this to a Gist button</code></p>
<p><code>That button should do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does, with the same use of localStorage and the same flow to get users signed in with a token if they are not already</code></p>
<p><code>So click the button, it asks the user to sign in if necessary, then it saves that HTML to a Gist in a file called index.html, gets back the Gist ID and shows the user the URL https://gistpreview.github.io/?6d778a8f9c4c2c005a189ff308c3bc47 - but with their gist ID in it</code></p>
<p><code>They can see the URL, they can click it (do not use target="_blank") and there is also a "Copy URL" button to copy it to their clipboard</code></p>
<p><code>Make the UI mobile friendly but also have it be courier green-text-on-black themed to reflect what it does</code></p>
<p><code>If the user pastes and the pasted data is available as HTML but not as RTF skip the RTF step and process the HTML directly</code></p>
<p><code>If the user pastes and it's only available as plain text then generate HTML that is just an open &lt;pre&gt; tag and their text and a closing &lt;/pre&gt; tag</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's quite a long prompt - it took me several minutes to type! But it covered the functionality I wanted in enough detail that I was pretty confident Claude would be able to build it.</p>
<h4 id="combining">Combining previous tools</h4>
<p>I'm using one key technique in this prompt: I'm referencing existing tools in the same repo and telling Claude to imitate their functionality.</p>
<p>I first wrote about this trick last March in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">Running OCR against PDFs and images directly in your browser</a>, where I described how a snippet of code that used PDF.js and another snippet that used Tesseract.js was enough for Claude 3 Opus to build me this <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">working PDF OCR tool</a>. That was actually the tool that kicked off my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> collection in the first place, which has since grown to 139 and counting.</p>
<p>Here I'm telling Claude that I want the RTF to HTML functionality of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/rtf-to-html.html">rtf-to-html.html</a> combined with the Gist saving functionality of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/openai-audio-output.html">openai-audio-output.html</a>.</p>
<p>That one has quite a bit going on. It uses the OpenAI audio API to generate audio output from a text prompt, which is returned by that API as base64-encoded data in JSON.</p>
<p>Then it offers the user a button to save that JSON to a Gist, which gives the snippet a URL.</p>
<p>Another tool I wrote, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/gpt-4o-audio-player.html">gpt-4o-audio-player.html</a>, can then accept that Gist ID in the URL and will fetch the JSON data and make the audio playable in the browser. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/gpt-4o-audio-player?gist=4a982d3fe7ba8cb4c01e89c69a4a5335">Here's an example</a>.</p>
<p>The trickiest part of this is API tokens. I've built tools in the past that require users to paste in a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (which I then store in <code>localStorage</code> in their browser - I don't want other people's authentication credentials anywhere near my own servers). But that's a bit fiddly.</p>
<p>Instead, I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/975b8934066417fe771561a1b672ad4f">figured out</a> the minimal Cloudflare worker necessary to implement the server-side portion of GitHub's authentication flow. That code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/cloudflare-workers/github-auth.js">lives here</a> and means that any of the HTML+JavaScript tools in my collection can implement a GitHub authentication flow if they need to save Gists.</p>
<p>But I don't have to tell the model any of that! I can just say "do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does" and Claude Code will work the rest out for itself.</p>
<h4 id="the-result">The result</h4>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html">the resulting app</a> looks like after I've pasted in some terminal output from Claude Code CLI:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/terminal-to-html.jpg" alt="Terminal to HTML app. Green glowing text on black. Instructions: Paste terminal output below. Supports RTF, HTML or plain text. There's an HTML Code area with a Copy HTML button, Save this to a Gist and a bunch of HTML. Below is the result of save to a gist showing a URL and a Copy URL button. Below that a preview with the Claude Code heading in ASCII art." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>It's exactly what I asked for, and the green-on-black terminal aesthetic is spot on too.</p>
<h4 id="other-notes-from-the-video">Other notes from the video</h4>
<p>There are a bunch of other things that I touch on in the video. Here's a quick summary:</p>

The <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/">launch post</a> mostly punted that question to <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-agent-system-card/">the System Card</a> for their "ChatGPT agent" browser automation feature from July. Since this was my single biggest question about Atlas I was disappointed not to see it addressed more directly.</p>
<p>OpenAI's Chief Information Security Officer Dane Stuckey just posted the most detail I've seen yet in <a href="https://twitter.com/cryps1s/status/1981037851279278414">a lengthy Twitter post</a>.</p>
<p>I'll quote from his post here (with my emphasis in bold) and add my own commentary.</p>
<p>He addresses the issue directly by name, with a good single-sentence explanation of the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One emerging risk we are very thoughtfully researching and mitigating is <strong>prompt injections, where attackers hide malicious instructions in websites, emails, or other sources, to try to trick the agent into behaving in unintended ways</strong>. The objective for attackers can be as simple as trying to bias the agent’s opinion while shopping, or as consequential as an attacker <strong>trying to get the agent to fetch and leak private data</strong>, such as sensitive information from your email, or credentials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We saw examples of browser agents from other vendors leaking private data in this way <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/21/unseeable-prompt-injections/">identified by the Brave security team just yesterday</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, <strong>the same way you’d trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague</strong> or friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting way to frame the eventual goal, describing an extraordinary level of trust and competence.</p>
<p>As always, a big difference between AI systems and a human is that an AI system <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/">cannot be held accountable for its actions</a>. I'll let my trusted friend use my logged-in browser only because there are social consequences if they abuse that trust!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re working hard to achieve that. For this launch, we’ve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, <strong>implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures</strong>, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks. However, <strong>prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agent fall for these attacks</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad to see OpenAI's CISO openly acknowledging that prompt injection remains an unsolved security problem (three years after we <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">started talking about it</a>!).</p>
<p>That "adversaries will spend significant time and resources" thing is the root of why I don't see guardrails and safety measures as providing a credible solution to this problem.</p>
<p>As I've written before, in application security <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/#prompt-injection.015">99% is a failing grade</a>. If there's a way to get past the guardrails, no matter how obscure, a motivated adversarial attacker is going to figure that out.</p>
<p>Dane goes on to describe some of those measures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To protect our users, and to help improve our models against these attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>We’ve prioritized rapid response systems to help us quickly identify block attack campaigns as we become aware of them.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this a lot. OpenAI have an advantage here of being a centralized system - they can monitor their entire user base for signs of new attack patterns.</p>
<p>It's still bad news for users that get caught out by a zero-day prompt injection, but it does at least mean that successful new attack patterns should have a small window of opportunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>We are also continuing to invest heavily in security, privacy, and safety - including research to improve the robustness of our models, security monitors, infrastructure security controls, and <strong>other techniques to help prevent these attacks via defense in depth</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>"Defense in depth" always sounds good, but it worries me that it's setting up a false sense of security here. If it's harder but still possible someone is going to get through.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>We’ve designed Atlas to give you controls to help protect yourself. <strong>We have added a feature to allow ChatGPT agent to take action on your behalf, but without access to your credentials called “logged out mode”</strong>. We recommend this mode when you don’t need to take action within your accounts. <strong>Today, we think “logged in mode” is most appropriate for well-scoped actions on very trusted sites, where the risks of prompt injection are lower</strong>. Asking it to add ingredients to a shopping cart is generally safer than a broad or vague request like “review my emails and take whatever actions are needed.”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Logged out mode is very smart, and is already a tried and tested pattern. I frequently have Claude Code or Codex CLI fire up Playwright to interact with websites, safe in the knowledge that they won't have access to my logged-in sessions. ChatGPT's existing <a href="https://chatgpt.com/features/agent/">agent mode</a> provides a similar capability.</p>
<p>Logged in mode is where things get scary, especially since we're delegating security decisions to end-users of the software. We've demonstrated many times over that this is an unfair burden to place on almost any user.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<strong>When agent is operating on sensitive sites, we have also implemented a "Watch Mode" that alerts you to the sensitive nature of the site and requires you have the tab active to watch the agent do its work</strong>. Agent will pause if you move away from the tab with sensitive information. This ensures you stay aware - and in control - of what agent actions the agent is performing. [...]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This detail is new to me: I need to spend more time with ChatGPT Atlas to see what it looks like in practice.</p>
<p>I tried just now using both GitHub and an online banking site and neither of them seemed to trigger "watch mode" - Atlas continued to navigate even when I had switched to another application.</p>
<p>Watch mode sounds reasonable in theory - similar to a driver-assisted car that requires you to keep your hands on the wheel - but I'd like to see it in action before I count it as a meaningful mitigation.</p>
<p>Dane closes with an analogy to computer viruses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New levels of intelligence and capability require the technology, society, the risk mitigation strategy to co-evolve. <strong>And as with computer viruses in the early 2000s, we think it’s important for everyone to understand responsible usage</strong>, including thinking about prompt injection attacks, so we can all learn to benefit from this technology safely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think the average computer user ever really got the hang of staying clear of computer viruses... we're still fighting that battle today, albeit much more successfully on mobile platforms that implement tight restrictions on what software can do.</p>
<p>My takeaways from all of this? It's not done much to influence my overall skepticism of the entire category of browser agents, but it does at least demonstrate that OpenAI are keenly aware of the problems and are investing serious effort in finding the right mix of protections.</p>
<p>How well those protections work is something I expect will become clear over the next few months.</p>

I decided to talk about a dichotomy I've been struggling with recently. On the one hand I'm getting <em>enormous</em> value from running coding agents with as few restrictions as possible. On the other hand I'm deeply concerned by the risks that accompany that freedom.</p>

  <p><code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> is a bit of a mouthful, so I'm going to use its better name, "YOLO mode", for the rest of this presentation.</p>
<p>Claude Code running in this mode genuinely feels like a <em>completely different product</em> from regular, default Claude Code.</p>
<p>The default mode requires you to pay constant attention to it, tracking everything it does and actively approving changes and actions every few steps.</p>
<p>In YOLO mode you can leave Claude alone to solve all manner of hairy problems while you go and do something else entirely.</p>
<p>I have a suspicion that many people who don't appreciate the value of coding agents have never experienced YOLO mode in all of its glory.</p>
<p>I'll show you three projects I completed with YOLO mode in just the past 48 hours.</p>

  <p>I wrote about this one at length in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/deepseek-ocr-claude-code/">Getting DeepSeek-OCR working on an NVIDIA Spark via brute force using Claude Code</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to try the newly released <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">DeepSeek-OCR</a> model on an NVIDIA Spark, but doing so requires figuring out how to run a model using PyTorch and CUDA, which is never easy and is a whole lot harder on an ARM64 device.</p>
<p>I SSHd into the Spark, started a fresh Docker container and told Claude Code to figure it out. It took 40 minutes and three additional prompts but it <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md">solved the problem</a>, and I got to have breakfast and tinker with some other projects while it was working.</p>

  <p>This project started out in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/20/claude-code-for-web/">Claude Code for the web</a>. I'm eternally interested in options for running server-side Python code inside a WebAssembly sandbox, for all kinds of reasons. I decided to see if the Claude iPhone app could launch a task to figure it out.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how hard it was to do that using <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> running directly in Node.js.</p>
<p>Claude Code got it working and built and tested <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/node-pyodide/server-simple.js">this demo script</a> showing how to do it.</p>
<p>I started a new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research">simonw/research</a> repository to store the results of these experiments, each one in a separate folder. It's up to 5 completed research projects already and I created it less than 2 days ago.</p>

  <p>Here's my favorite, a project from just this morning.</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to try out <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCCount</a>, a 2001-era Perl tool for counting lines of code and estimating the cost to develop them using 2001 USA developer salaries.</p>
<p>.. but I didn't want to run Perl, so I decided to have Claude Code (for web, and later on my laptop) try and figure out how to run Perl scripts in WebAssembly.</p>
<p>TLDR: it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/sloccount-in-webassembly/">got there in the end</a>! It turned out some of the supporting scripts in SLOCCount were written in C, so it had to compile those to WebAssembly as well.</p>
<p>And now <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount">tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount</a> is a browser-based app which runs 25-year-old Perl+C in WebAssembly against pasted code, GitHub repository references and even zip files full of code.</p>

  <p>The wild thing is that all three of these projects weren't even a priority for me - they were side quests, representing pure curiosity that I could outsource to Claude Code and solve in the background while I was occupied with something else.</p>
<p>I got a lot of useful work done in parallel to these three flights of fancy.</p>

  <p>The reason for this is <strong>prompt injection</strong>, a term I coined <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">three years ago</a> to describe a class of attacks against LLMs that take advantage of the way untrusted content is concatenated together with trusted instructions. </p>

  <p>Here's a great example of a prompt injection attack against a coding agent, <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/openhands-the-lethal-trifecta-strikes-again/">described by Johann Rehberger</a> as part of his <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/announcement-the-month-of-ai-bugs/">Month of AI Bugs</a>, sharing a new prompt injection report every day for the month of August.</p>
<p>If a coding agent - in this case <a href="https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands">OpenHands</a> -  reads this <code>env.html</code> file it can be tricked into grepping the available environment variables for <code>hp_</code> (matching GitHub Personal Access Tokens) and sending that to the attacker's external server for "help debugging these variables".</p>

  <p>I coined another term to try and describe a common subset of prompt injection attacks: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">the lethal trifecta</a>.</p>
<p>Any time an LLM system combines <strong>access to private data</strong> with <strong>exposure to untrusted content</strong> and the <strong>ability to externally communicate</strong>, there's an opportunity for attackers to trick the system into leaking that private data back to them.</p>
<p>These attacks are <em>incredibly common</em>. If you're running YOLO coding agents with access to private source code or secrets (like API keys in environment variables) you need to be concerned about the potential of these attacks.</p>

  <p>Some people will try to convince you that prompt injection attacks can be solved using more AI to detect the attacks. This does not work 100% reliably, which means it's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/">not a useful security defense at all</a>.</p>

  <p>The best sandboxes are the ones that run on someone else's computer! That way the worst that can happen is someone else's computer getting owned.</p>
<p>You still need to worry about your source code getting leaked. Most of my stuff is open source anyway, and a lot of the code I have agents working on is research code with no proprietary secrets.</p>
<p>If your code really is sensitive you need to consider network restrictions more carefully, as discussed in a few slides.</p>

  <p>There are two problems to consider with sandboxing. </p>
<p>The first is easy: you need to control what files can be read and written on the filesystem.</p>
<p>The second is much harder: controlling the network connections that can be made by code running inside the agent.</p>

  <p>The reason network access is so important is that it represents the data exfiltration leg of the lethal trifecta. If you can prevent external communication back to an attacker they can't steal your private information, even if they manage to sneak in their own malicious instructions.</p>

  <p>The key to the implementation - at least on macOS - is Apple's little known but powerful <code>sandbox-exec</code> command.</p>
<p>This provides a way to run any command in a sandbox configured by a policy document.</p>
<p>Those policies can control which files are visible but can also allow-list network connections. Anthropic run an HTTP proxy and allow the Claude Code environment to talk to that, then use the proxy to control which domains it can communicate with.</p>
<p>(I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/d945e2da-0f89-49cd-a373-494b550e3377">used Claude itself</a> to synthesize this example from Anthropic's codebase.)</p>

This project/side-quest got a little bit out of hand.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of SLOCCount web application showing code analysis interface. The page header reads &quot;SLOCCount - Count Lines of Code&quot; with subtitle &quot;Analyze source code to count physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) using Perl and C programs running via WebAssembly&quot; and &quot;Based on SLOCCount by David A.

Below is a text input field labeled &quot;GitHub Repository URL:&quot; containing &quot;simonw/llm&quot; and a blue &quot;Analyze Repository&quot; button. The Analysis Results section displays five statistics: Total Lines: 13,490, Languages: 2, Files: 40, Est. Cost (USD)*: $415,101, and Est. Person-Years*: 3.07." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/sloccount.jpg" class="blogmark-image" style="max-width: 95%;"></p>
<p>I remembered an old tool called SLOCCount which could count lines of code and produce an estimate for how much they would cost to develop. I thought it would be fun to play around with it again, especially given how cheap it is to generate code using LLMs these days.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">the homepage for SLOCCount</a> by David A. Wheeler. It dates back to 2001!</p>
<p>I figured it might be fun to try and get it running on the web. Surely someone had compiled Perl to WebAssembly...?</p>
<p><a href="https://webperl.zero-g.net">WebPerl</a> by Hauke Dämpfling is exactly that, even adding a neat <code>&lt;script type="text/perl"&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>I told Claude Code for web on my iPhone to figure it out and build something, giving it some hints from my initial research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build sloccount.html - a mobile friendly UI for running the Perl sloccount tool against pasted code or against a GitHub repository that is provided in a form field</p>
<p>It works using the webperl webassembly build of Perl, plus it loads Perl code from this exact commit of this GitHub repository https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/tree/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e - I guess via the GitHub API, maybe using the https://github.com/licquia/sloccount/archive/7220ff627334a8f646617fe0fa542d401fb5287e.zip URL if that works via CORS</p>
<p>Test it with playwright Python - don’t edit any file other than sloccount.html and a tests/test_sloccount.py file</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I was working on my phone I didn't review the results at all. It seemed to work so I deployed it to static hosting... and then when I went to look at it properly later on found that Claude had given up, cheated and reimplemented it in JavaScript instead!</p>
<p>So I switched to Claude Code on my laptop where I have more control and coached Claude through implementing the project for real. This took <em>way longer</em> than the project deserved - probably a solid hour of my active time, spread out across the morning.</p>
<p>I've shared some of the transcripts - <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf#simonw/0fc406a18e14a1f7d28bfff02a18eaaf">one</a>, <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?56ecae45cf2e1baca798a83deea50939">two</a>, and <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?79ca231e801fe1188268a54d30aa67ed">three</a> - as terminal sessions rendered to HTML using my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/rtf-to-html">rtf-to-html</a> tool.</p>
<p>At one point I realized that the original SLOCCount project wasn't even entirely Perl as I had assumed, it included several C utilities! So I had Claude Code figure out how to compile those to WebAssembly (it used Emscripten) and incorporate those into the project (with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/473e89edfebc27781b434430f2e8a76adfbe3b16/lib/README.md#webassembly-compilation-of-c-programs">notes on what it did</a>.)</p>
<p>The end result (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/sloccount.html">source code here</a>) is actually pretty cool. It's a web UI with three tabs - one for pasting in code, a second for loading code from a GitHub repository and a third that lets you open a Zip file full of code that you want to analyze. Here's an animated demo:</p>
<p><img alt="I enter simonw/llm in the GitHub repository field. It loads 41 files from GitHub and displays a report showing the number of lines and estimated cost." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/sloccount-optimized.gif" /></p>
<p>The cost estimates it produces are of very little value. By default it uses the original method from 2001. You can also twiddle the factors - bumping up the expected US software engineer's annual salary from its 2000 estimate of $56,286 is a good start! </p>
<p>I had ChatGPT <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68f7e0ac-00c4-8006-979e-64d1f0162283">take a guess</a> at what those figures should be for today and included those in the tool, with a <strong>very</strong> prominent warning not to trust them in the slightest.

You can't disable this entirely, but you can at least delay it for 274 years by adding this to your <code>~/.claude/settings.json</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "cleanupPeriodDays": 99999
}
</code></pre>
<p>Claude Code's settings are <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings">documented here</a>.</p>
